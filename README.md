### I'm Started CodeDex

### First question is:

```

Create some variables for your favorite company with the following data types:

companyName, a string.
foundingYear, a number.
isActive, a Boolean.
fundingAmount, undefined.
Print them out using console.log().

```

### my answer 

```

let companyName = "Aslan";
let foundingYear = 2025;
let isActive = true;
let fundingAmount;

console.log(companyName);
console.log(foundingYear);
console.log(isActive);
console.log(fundingAmount);

```

### 2-question

```

Let's put these operators to use!

Create a temperature.js program that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C).

Google the current temperature of Brooklyn, NY (where Codédex is based) in °F.

Use the following formula and write it out in JavaScript:


Celsius= 
1.8
(Fahrenheit−32)
​
Print out the converted temperature using console.log().

```

### my answer

```

const fahrenheit = 70;
const celcius = 32;

let tip = (fahrenheit - celcius) / 1.8;

console.log(tip)

```
